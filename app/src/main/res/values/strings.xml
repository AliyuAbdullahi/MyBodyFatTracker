    <string name="three_sites_info">The three-site skinfold test is a method to estimate body fat percentage using skinfold measurements at three specific locations. For men, the common sites are the chest, abdomen, and thigh. For women, the common sites are the triceps, suprailiac, and thigh. The measurements are taken using skinfold calipers and then plugged into gender-specific equations to calculate body density, which is then converted to body fat percentage. </string>
    <string name="seven_sites_info">The seven-site skinfold measurement method for assessing body fat involves using calipers to measure subcutaneous fat thickness at specific locations on the body. These locations are the triceps, biceps, subscapular, supraspinale (or suprailiac), abdominal, thigh, and chest. These measurements, when combined, can provide an estimation of overall body fat percentage. It offers slightly better accuracy than three sites skinfold measurement.</string>
